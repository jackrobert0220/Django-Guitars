# Django Guitars

## Description

- A web-based application where guitar enthusiasts may post their unique guitars for selling or trading!
   
Users are able to:
- üé∏ post their own guitar with details, once signed up
- üîç view all guitars posted by all users
- üì≤ update guitar data, such as image, color, brand, etc.
- üì§ contact other users via email link (only available if signed up)

- The application serves as a one-stop-shop for super-rare guitars that you cannot find on most websites. 

- By creating Django Guitars, I was able to better understand Django's functionality and take advantage of the framework's built-in features, such as error handling and admin access.

# User-Flow:

- Create a login to begin posting your guitar/bass collection online for others to check out.

- Once logged in, user will gain the ability to post to their profile of 
   their guitar along with its attributes: 
   - Brand

   - Price 
   - Number of Strings 
   - Color
   - Image

    - Brand
    - Active (y/n)

- After posting either Guitars and/or Hardware Options, the user will 
   have the ability to UPDATE and DELETE their POSTS.

- User must be logged in to utilize the above-mentioned functions.
